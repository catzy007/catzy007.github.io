#### My Journey Managing My Own Homelab
_Sunday, November 19, 2023_

Recently or more specifically few months ago, I acquire a new machine 
which is going to replace my dying Proxmox server from 2020. The machine 
in question is a Lenovo ThinkCentre M900 SFF with a sticker price of 
roughly 45 USD and include a Pentium G4400 2 Core 2 Thread CPU, 4 GB 
RAM and 500 GB Mechanical spinning drive. While this specs may not seem 
"impressive", In my local area it is a decent deal considering my 
use case and upgrade that I'm planning to do.

The first thing that I did is to upgrade the RAM. Fortunately Lenovo 
M900 has 4 slots of DDR4 RAM which is already populated with single 
stick of DDR4 4 GB RAM, and fortunately for me, I have 3 sticks of 
DDR4 4Â GB lying around making the total system memory to 16 GB which 
is enough for my use cases, unless I play around with AI and require 
more system memory.
