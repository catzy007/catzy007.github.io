#### Flashing OpenWrt onto ZTE ZXA10 F660 V3
_Saturday, July 22, 2023_

A lot is happening recently, I started moving and live alone, and I had 
a full-time job now. Of course, I still want to play around with new 
things and here we are.

For a while I'm trying to find / build open-source, inexpensive, scalable 
and fully manageable home router solution. Then I stumble upon an OpenWrt 
based router. My attempt so far was to use x86-x64 based system with 
virtualization therefore I can run multiple services inside one box. 
But I find out later that the I/O throughput is not enough. My next 
option is to use a dedicated box and the first candidate is Xiaomi MIR4A 
it supports OpenWrt and had enough storage and ram for my uses, but it 
lacks a USB port. My second candidate is ZTE F660 V3 which comes from my 
old internet provider. Apparently my unit had 128 MB RAM, 128 MB NAND 
which is plenty for my use case and a USB port.
