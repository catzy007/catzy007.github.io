In case you're just graduate from school or uni, loves drawing or 
digital design or simply just need extra cash here is some of my insight.

First, what suit you better. There are multiple types of digital design. 
Digital printing design, user interface and experience design for Website, 
UI/UX design for mobile devices, and then there are more artistic design 
like game art design, digital drawing, digital illustration, and 3D 
rendering/modelling.

There are probably more than i listed above, but the basics is similar 
by doing a brainstorming, creating sketch, and repeat. Then the question 
becomes which one fit yours? The easiest way is to just try. Don't worry 
too much about tools, use free software, use system you currently have 
like fully working laptop, tablet, smartphones or even use paper and pencil. 
What i mean is if you will, you can.

Then improve your skill and learn from written media like blogs or websites, 
learn from watching VOD and see others do it, then try it yourself. 

My experience with digital printing design and UI design for website. 
The first thing i did is to listen to client request, bring paper and pencil, 
draw sketch according to client request, then repeat until it is close 
enough to client request. I also give client my advice like if i did this, 
it will reduce the time to X amount, or do this to make color pop, things like 
that. Don't forget to ask for time, budget and special request if any.

If everything went smoothly, plan a working schedule and start working on it. 
Then once in a while, contact your client and tell your progress or ask for 
advice. Once it's done present your work, and hopefully you get good results 
and gain more experiences.

As for software, for digital printing and UI design i use mostly 
Inkscape and GIMP but sometimes client ask to make design using Corel Draw or even 
Adobe Photoshop. For digital drawing i use Krita, Adobe Photoshop and Sketchbook 
(Android) some may suggest Clip Studio Paint and PaintTool SAI. As for 3D i use 
Blender and SketchUp with Vray as rendering engine. Some may suggest 3ds Max and 
ZBrush.

For tools, I have use XP-Pen USB Tablet and Samsung Tablet with S-Pen before for 
drawing. Other than that, i use paper and pencil. For computers, i use system 
ranging from Intel Pentium with 2 Cores and Nvidia 610M for 2D design to Intel 
Xeon with 24 Threads and Radeon 560 for 3D rendering with lots of polygons and refection.

To recap, to be a digital designer, pick which suit you best. The easiest way to do 
that is to learn and watch others do it, the practice yourself. Don't worry too much 
about software and system to use as `A tool is only as good as its users`.
