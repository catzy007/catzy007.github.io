#### Fixing my old speaker
_Thursday, March 30, 2023_

For quite some time I wanted something fun, I need something musical, I need to 
fix my old speaker. Which I get from my family member a long time ago, I don't 
even remember what brand it was. The design for me was enticing it also had blue 
ambient lighting which later I replace with RGB lighting which finally I took 
away. The sound quality is not bad but not that good either, and it has a high 
pitch noise when no sound is being played which bother me so much. Funnily 
enough, I asked several people about this high pitch noise and some can hear it 
while some could not, and it is the reason why I wanted to replace the internal 
with something more modern.

The first thing I did was to disassemble the unit and find the 
[impedance rating](https://www.hifireport.com/speaker-impedance/) 
of each driver. For the tweeter driver, the impedance is written clearly as 4 
ohms. Unfortunately the same can't be said about subwoofer driver, it is 
completely stuck inside the wooden frame, so the only way is to measure it. 
I grab my multimeter, set it as resistance mode and probe the connector. The 
measurement came up around 8 ohms which according to several sources, the 
measured impedance should be 15% lower than the actual impedance and the 
impedance rating should be around 10 ohms.

Next thing I did is to find a suitable amplifier for my set-up. If the impedance 
rating of my drivers is lower than the amplifier expect, it could blow itself to 
death. If it is too high, the amplifier may not be able to drive it. In the end 
I choose Wuzhi Audio ZK-LT21 which is 2.1 channel D class audio amplifier. It 
also supports Bluetooth, USB and regular AUX. The only drawback is that this 
amplifier is rated for 4 to 8 ohms driver and my heavy subwoofer driver is 10 
ohms I guess I just max the subwoofer volume and adjust everything else in EQ.

Compared to the original internals, it is like a night and day. Not only in the 
size footprint, the sound quality is also improved. The sound stage is wider 
and sharper and the note is separated quite nicely. Yes it is not the best 
ever but at 10 USD shipped, it is good enough for me.

The last thing I did is to dismantle the original internals, wire everything up, 
do a final test before closing the panel then do a test and adjust the EQ. As for 
test track, I use a variety of songs like Crab Rave, God Knows, Bury the Light, 
11:11, When the wind blows, River flows in you nightcore, Black Parade, Golden 
Time and many others. Each track meant as a way to measure if the system overall 
perform well for example if God Knows played in improperly configured stereo 
set-up, the electric guitar part is going to be missing altogether. As for my 
set-up, everything is passed with flying colours except Golden Time. It has a 
short burst bass and apparently my power supply I pull from random internet 
router somewhere could not handle it, well I guess new power supply next time.
