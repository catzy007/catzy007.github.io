### Trying Portable Cassette Player in 2021
_Thursday, December 16, 2021_

First, what exactly is Cassette player? If you live around 80s to 90s, or you watch older movie from that era, 
you'll find something like this.

It's an audio player device (some model can be used to record and some can play radio as well) that uses 
storage media called `Cassette Tape` it should look like this.

It consists of two plastic ribbon spools with magnetic ferrite mix, chrome or metal particle on one the surface. 
The way it works is part of magnetic ribbon is magnetized with varying intensity according to the music. 
This magnetic fluctuation then gets detected by tape head on the player unit as electric impulse, get 
amplified then sent to your headphone as music. There is also a digital version (DAT) that require 
data decoding and digital to analog conversion to get the music.

One day, i dig into random box in the storage area and found few cassette tapes from one of my family member. 
Some of them are self recorded and some of them are music album and i wanted to hear it, but i can't find any 
player on hand so i try to get one.

My first attempt is to get a "broken" device in hope that i can fix it myself. Found 3 for 10 USD which 
is not that bad unless it is.

Starting from the left is Panasonic RX-SX20 including battery adapter but seems like the paint is destroyed 
by what i think is battery acid. Then in the middle is Sony WM-FX37. Then the last one is Aiwa which is the 
most interesting for me.

Here is my attempt to fix RX-SX20. Some traces clearly broken and with my current capability of fixing things 
now, i don't think that i can do it. Here is my [iFixit forum post](https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/714615/Battery+leak+require+board+level+repair)

The Sony one, well it looks clean outside and after opening it up, it seems like some caps on the board went 
missing, get a belt installed it seems spinning. But after putting it back together and placing a tape inside, 
it suddenly stopped and after checking it up, both roller just gone. So this player seems used as a part 
before.

Then Aiwa player which look rough outside and at first, didn't work. After opening it up it seems like battery 
connector is falling off and simply sanding off the rust and soldering it back, it works. Only radio works. 
But it looks amazing, manual works anywhere it seems so `Cyber-punk` for me.

Well with most of the player are not going well, i try to get other one. It is Panasonic RQ-SX60F which is 
similar to RQ-SX65F model. It advertised as not working but no battery leak this time.

I get myself a [service manual](https://elektrotanya.com/panasonic_rq-sx60f.pdf/download.html) open it up, and 
it seems like water get inside. So i took the board out, took the LCD out, spray the board with contact 
cleaner, and it seems that some solder connector getting black instead of shiny silver. So i just add little 
flux and flow the solder again. And you know what it works again. But one of the gear just break, so only 
radio is working. But hey, it looks amazing and sound wonderful for device 2 decades old. Picture below is 
board before cleaning.

Then i found a listing about working player for cheap. It is Sony WM-FX211 including one tape. Looks good and 
sleek, a bit thick for my taste, but tape and radio works and sound good.

The only issues with this player are one of the capacitor, or should i say `supercapacitor` is bulging a 
little. Can't seem to find it easily. At least not in my local area. Here is the spec and part number 
`0.056F 3.5V FYD0V563ZF`. At least for now it still works just fine.
