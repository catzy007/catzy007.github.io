The way it works is part of magnetic ribbon is magnetised with varying intensity according to the music. 
This magnetic fluctuation then get detected by tape head on the player unit as electric impulse, get 
amplified then sent to your headphone as music. There is a digital version (DAT) as well that require 
data decoding and digital to analog conversion to get the music.
