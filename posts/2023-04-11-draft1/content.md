#### Draft1

For quite some time I wanted something fun, I need something musical, I need to 
fix my old speaker. Which I get from my family member a long time ago, I don't 
even remember what brand it was. The design for me was enticing it also had blue 
ambient lighting which later I replace with RGB lighting which finally I took 
away. The sound quality is not bad but not that good either, and it has a high 
pitch noise when no sound is being played which bother me so much. Funnily 
enough, I asked several people about this high pitch noise and some can hear it 
while some could not, and it is the reason why I wanted to replace the internal 
with something more modern.
