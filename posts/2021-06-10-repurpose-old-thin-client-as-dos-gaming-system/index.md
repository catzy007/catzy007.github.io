### **Repurpose Old Thin Client as DOS Gaming System**
_Thursday, June 10, 2021_

Few weeks ago i need to test my DOS program in baremetal. So i started looking around 
local shop and shock to find that old i486 computer cost double than i3 sandy bridge computer. 
Even Pentium 3 cost little bit more than i3 sandy bridge computer. So you know what, forget 
about it. 

The problem was i need to interface with sound system (Sound Blaster or Adlib) and newer computer 
simply doesn't support old sound system anymore. So i started to looking around the internet and 
found out that some Thin Client with specific chipset can do Sound Blaster and Adlib.

Supported chipset is VIA VT8231 and VT82C686. Looking around <https://www.parkytowers.me.uk/thin/hware/hardware.shtml> 
i found HP T5700 so i just search my local shop and failed to find anything. Then i look again and 
it seems like T5700 is rebranded T5000 with almost exact internal. So i look for T5000 and 
sure enough find it for 10 USD so yeah that's good.

Then i take it home and notice a `Asset code` from local bank, when i plug it up i see some 
data still there. So what i do is format the disk and everything is mine now. Then what i found 
interesting is that the two different sticker said different thing, so one of them said T5000 
and the other one said T5700. If any of you need this, look for both keyword.

The specification for this is Transmeta Crusoe TM5800 in my case the clock speed is 733MHz with 
512MB of DDR memory and 512MB of storage (IDE DOM) and ATI Rage XL GPU. From the sticker it should come 
with 192/256 whatever that is. As for the operating system, it comes with Windows XP Embedded.

Then i change the IDE DOM to 2GB then i try to install Windows 98 on it.
