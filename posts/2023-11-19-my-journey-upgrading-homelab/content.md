#### My Journey Upgrading Homelab
_Sunday, November 19, 2023_

Recently or more specifically few months ago, I acquire a new machine 
which is going to replace my dying Proxmox server from 2020. The machine 
in question is a Lenovo ThinkCentre M900 SFF with a sticker price of 
roughly 45 USD and include a Pentium G4400 2 Core 2 Thread CPU, 4 GB 
RAM and 500 GB mechanical spinning drive. While this specs may not seem 
"impressive", In my local area it is a decent deal considering my 
use case and upgrade that I'm planning to do.

The first thing that I did is to upgrade the RAM. Lenovo M900 has 4 
slots of DDR4 RAM which is already populated with a single 
stick of DDR4 4 GB RAM, and fortunately for me, I have 3 sticks of 
DDR4 4Â GB lying around making the total system memory to 16 GB which 
is enough for my use cases, unless I play around with AI and require 
more system memory.

The next upgrade is to add a GPU. But because my system is SFF form 
factor, I can't just use any GPU and expect it to fit. Instead, I 
have to use specific GPU called "Low-Profile" not the standard 
"Full-Height" one. There are few consumer-class GPU that are available 
in this form factor such as GTX 1050 or GTX 1650, but the majority of 
the GPU is either workstation or server-class one such as Quadro 
or Tesla lineup. In my case, I'm using NVIDIA Quadro K620 2 GB which 
I acquire for about 25 USD. Other than that, I only add DVI to HDMI 
adapter and HDMI Dummy Adapter because I plan to run this Headless.

Then I power it up, download and install latest Proxmox VE, backup 
and restore all services from my old server and plug it straight 
into the interweb with a proper protection. But how does it run? 
For the past month it has been fine actually with only minor thing such 
as high IO delay because of mechanical hard drive instead of a solid 
state one which I'm planning upgrade later.

The next thing I did is to try GPU Passthrough. The last time I did this 
back in 2019 with a Radeon GPU. Now a lot has changed, and I use NVIDIA 
GPU instead. Here are the resources that I use as a reference.

[PCI Passthrough - Proxmox VE](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/PCI_Passthrough)

[Proxmox PCI(e) Passthrough in 2 minutes : r/Proxmox](https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/lcnn5w/proxmox_pcie_passthrough_in_2_minutes/)

First, go to BIOS and enable Virtualization and VT-D. Then boot into 
the machine and do the following.
```
nano /etc/default/grub
	GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet intel_iommu=on iommu=pt nofb video=efifb:off"
update-grub
nano /etc/modules
	vfio
	vfio_iommu_type1
	vfio_virqfd
	vfio_pci
nano /etc/initramfs-tools/modules
	vfio
	vfio_iommu_type1
	vfio_virqfd
	vfio_pci
nano /etc/modprobe.d/pve-blacklist.conf
	blacklist nvidiafb
	blacklist nouveau
	blacklist snd_hda_intel
update-initramfs -u -k all
reboot
dmesg | grep -E DMAR
```
If nothing goes wrong, you should get `DMAR: Intel(R) Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O`.

	<div class="col-sm-3"></div>
</div>

Then add GPU and GPU Audio PCIe device ID in vfio-pci options.
```
lspci -vnn | grep -iP "vga|amdgpu|nvidia|nouveau|vfio-pci"
nano /etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf
	options vfio-pci ids=10de:13bb,10de:0fbc disable_vga=1
update-initramfs -u -k all
reboot
lspci -vnn | grep -iP "vga|amdgpu|nvidia|nouveau|vfio-pci"
```
If nothing goes wrong, you should get `Kernel driver in use: vfio-pci`

</div>

Next, create a new VM with `OVMF (UEFI)` BIOS and machine type as 
`Q35 8.0` for CPU type I set it as `Host`.

Then Add GPU as PCI Device, Check `All functions` and `PCI Express`, 
make sure `Primary GPU` is left uncheck.

	</div>
	<div class="col-sm-3"></div>
</div>

After that, boot the OS then download and install the NVIDIA Driver 
followed by your favorite remote desktop software.

Next reboot the and power off the VM.

Then in VM settings, set `Display` to `VirtIO-GPU (virtio)` and 
Check `Primary GPU` in `PCI Device`. 

Last, boot and remote to your VM, and hopefully it is working.

The next upgrade that I did is to add a Solid State Drive or more like 
two of them. The first SSD is just a regular Samsung 256 GB M.2 SATA. 
The other one is 16 GB of Intel Optane that I use as a boot drive. 
Compared to a traditional NAND based SSD, Optane is faster (IOPS) and 
has higher endurance rating (TBW) but since Q2 2022 Intel announce that 
development of future Optane product is ceased.
