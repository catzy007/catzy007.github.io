### **Nintendo DSI in 2021**
_Monday, October 18, 2021_

Recently, i found interesting listing about Nintendo DSI. It's White DSI with JP language, 
working battery, vibrant screen no crack no dead pixel at least from the picture. 
The seller said that it just stuck in this Japanese error message, the digitizer 
doesn't work, the button is not working at the price of 10 USD, i just take it. 
Few days later, it came and to my surprise it comes with Stylus, SD to Micro SD adapter 
and R4 clone. Then i power it up and i get this message.

After googling around, i found few posts about this topic 
[Yahoo! Chiebukuro](https://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q1131130136) and 
[Oshiete! Goo](https://oshiete.goo.ne.jp/qa/4596782.html) 
all of them said that i should hold `L R Start` button then press `Power`. 
By doing this, the system should boot into `Calibration` mode and 
after following the on-screen instructions, it should work again.
```
はじめに本体の設定をします。
OKをタッチしてください。

I tried that, and it doesn't work at all. So i disassemble my unit then using multimeter 
i found out that the `R` button is not registering. So i tried to get replacement part 
which consist of ribbon cable, LR button, and SD assembly but could not find it locally. 
Then i look for the Button Switches and get a listing 10 pcs at 1 USD + Shipping. Check

Few days later my switches arrive and i start my disassembly again, then using micro pencil 
solder tip i desolder the old switches, clean the pad, solder new switches and to my surprise 
it works. One thing to note here is that the new switches feel different from the original 
but as long as it's working just fine then i'll take it.

Next thing i did is to check if everything works. Also to my surprise, the system did not 
really have any owner data. No names, games, disware, only few blurry photos. So i decided 
to do a system wipe and try to update the firmware to the latest version.

So i just connect it to Wi-Fi and update the system firmware from 1.0 to 1.45 then i go to 
dsiware and download web browser just to make the system more useable.
