#### Large Language Model and Artificial Intelligence
_Thursday, April 6, 2023_

Large Language Model (LLM) is a probabilistic distribution of token 
(human-readable words) consisting of neural-network with typically billions 
of parameters [1]. LLM is part of study called Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
which helps computer understand, interpret, and manipulate human language [2]. 
One of the way for computer to understand natural language is First Order Logic 
(FOL) which consist of axioms and inference rules this can be used as a way 
to represent knowledge [3]. Unlike FOL, the way LLM represent knowledge 
specifically the current Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) is by 
weighing (storing) the significance of each part of input data then it can 
use the weight (model) to predict the next element in a text, usually a word, 
based on previous natural language texts [4][5][6]. More about how LLM works.

In the recent times there has been an exceptional development in LLM. From 
millions of parameter to hundreds of billions parameter [7] this resulted to 
an interesting outcome such as Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) 
found in GPT-4 [8]. AGI is a hypothetical form of intelligent agent that can learn, 
understand and perform an intellectual task that human can [9]. In other word, and this 
is a direct quote from LLM called Alpaca-7B "An AI system should be able to make 
decisions based on all the information that it has access to. It should be able to 
interpret data from the environment and to act accordingly. It should have the capacity 
to learn from its mistakes, to evaluate and reevaluate decisions, and to communicate 
and collaborate with other systems". Below is a video which summarize the paper and 
a link to the paper PDF.

With great power comes great responsibility, this is what AI scientist face right now. 
On one side, it is great to see progress in AI. On the other side, what if one day this 
fully-fledged AI system existed. The problem is that currently no one knows how this 
Large Language Model capable of doing what they can right now nor even predict and 
control their behavior. This become an interesting topic and Open Letter is created 
to pause AI development more powerful than GPT-4 for 6 months

As for interesting side note, here is what Bing Chat which apparently based on 
GPT-4 thinks about the future AI and their implications.
