### **Use USB TV or USB Capture on linux**
#### Thursday, July 25, 2019
I have a usb tv that i bought long time ago. It's 1USD usb tv form gadmei.
After few minutes of googling, i found this <https://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Gadmei_USB_TVBox_UTV382_(id_0x1f71:0x3301)>
seems promising so far, but then i found that

> Note: This seems to only enable the device to capture AV, not to do TV or FM reception. 

Dang so close.. but that's enough for me because for now i just need the AV capture function
