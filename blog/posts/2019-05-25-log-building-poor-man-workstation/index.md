### **Log Building Poor Man Workstation**
#### Saturday, 25 May 2019

Hello, this is my first post after migrating to <github.io>. Okay this 
is the story, I need a multi core machine with as high 
performance/price as possible. But building machine from new part that 
equivalent with my need can empty my wallet in no time. So i watch 
this video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IK0Yer4XTc> and surprise 
that 10 years old processor can hold up. So i looking around a 
overclockable motherboard and found that still surprisingly expensive. 
So i'm doing more research and found this motherboard 
[Asus Z8NA-D6](https://www.asus.com/Commercial-Servers-Workstations/Z8NAD6/) 
It has 2 socket LGA1366 with 6 bank of ram an support for ECC 
Registered ram. Perfect.

And day after that i quickly made this build plan.

```
Nvidia 970 @1.2JT
AMD 570 4G @1JT ~ 1.3JT

COOLER/HSF ~10$ x 2
 14USD/ea 4tube
 22USD/ea 6tube

MOUNT FOR HSF

PROCIE
 x5675
 X5670 ~20$ x 2
 X5660 x2

ANY BOARD < 130$ !
 X8DTL-3F
 Z8NA-D6 ~100$
 Z8NR-D12 ~120$
```

Fast forward and some time with customs and the first item has arrive. 
That was the motherboard. It even come with IO Shield too

Next thing i want to buy is processor. And i made tables about 
performance/dollar. The price is double because i need 2 processor
```
Model. | CLK  | CB.  | $  | cb/$  | DLT | $DLT
 X5650 @ 2.66   1279 / 22 = 58.     0     0
 X5660 @ 2.90   1360 / 34 = 40.     81    12
 X5670 @ 2.94   1410 / 44 = 32.04   50    10
 X5675 @ 3.06   1471 / 60 = 24.51   61    16
```
Hopefully i can get X5670 without much problem.
