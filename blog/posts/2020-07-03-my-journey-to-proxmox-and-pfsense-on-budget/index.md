### **My Journey To Proxmox and pFsense On Budget**
_Friday, July 3, 2020_

Few weeks ago, i come to an online listing. They sell an `HP Thin Client T5730` at around 20 USD, 
i tought it was really good price. Yeah you can comment `its not a good deal you dumb` yeah i know 
i live in region where even 10 year old computer still hold it's price really strong. So i might try 
to snatch it in. Then i watch video about this thin client from `PhilsComputerLab` 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekRQS-uyJ4Y> and find out that this thin client has upgradeable 
processor and that would be interesting.

The feature i was looking from this thin client is 64Bit support. Many newer ubuntu based distros 
has dropped support for 32Bit based system. The other thin client `T5740` has intel Atom with 
HyperThreading but it only support 32Bit so yeah drop that even tho T5740 has internal SATA connector. 
I also stumble upon listing for `gt7725` which had dual core 64Bit system and had two slot for RAM. 
But the seller said it's sold out. So finally i pick `T5730` and do a little gamble. I'm gonna put 
Dual Core processor in that, give it 2GB ram, and anything that can make SATA drive work on that system.
