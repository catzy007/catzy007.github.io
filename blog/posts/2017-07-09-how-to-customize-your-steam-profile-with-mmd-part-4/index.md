7. In Video Options, set Duration to your video duration. in this case my video has 27 second on it 
and if your video has 30FPS then put number 3 on Frame Interval if you don't know where the 30FPS come from then just put number 3 on it (~'-')~

10. yaay after convert it's mean that i can upload it into steam artwork right? NO... or not yet.
> First Check your GIF size. if your file has size more or equal to 8MB then try to reduce video length. 

> Or if your GIF size is less than 8MB then it's time to upload it into your steam profile and set it in artwork showcase... 

Some Explanation
1. Main idea of part 2 is to take image from background based on template. you can use whatever image editor you have... i use Linux because i like to see you confused \('-')/
2. The reason of Step 5 in part 4 is to compress image so it's smaller than uncompressed gif... idk how this is going.. but if it's work then why not?
3. Actually your animation duration can be anything... as soon as finished GIF size is less than 8MB 
4. Image Height can be more than 506px but Width only limited to 506px
5. You are not limited to use MMD. you can use anything from as simple as MovieMaker or AfterEffect, Source Filmmaker, Premiere, Blender or anything you can imagine. just dont forget to convert it into GIF
6. You can modify any parameter, any variable or anything you want to try!
